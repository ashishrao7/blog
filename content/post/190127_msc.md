## Restoring senses with neuroprostheses

I conducted a 9-week research project at the Munich School of Bio-Engineering with the Bio-Inspired Information Processing Chair investigating multipulse train integration in Cochlear Implant (CI) users. 
CIs allow people with severe hearing loss to perceive sound again or for the first time and are the most successful neuroprostheses restoring a human sense so far.

### How are multiple pulses integrated in the auditory system?

Cochlear Implants (CIs) restore auditory perception through direct electrial stimulation of auditory nerve fibres in the cochlear. 
Hearing with state of the art CIs is still far from optimal and different stimulation strategies need to be tested to improve speech perception.
Temporal integration of stimulus pulses poses a natural limit to high stimulation rates.
How multiple pulses are integrated in the auditory system and hence how high the stimulation rates could be is yet unknown. 
To address this question Auguste together with a PhD student in the lab combined psychophysics with instrumental measurements using electrically evoked auditory brain stem responses (eABR) in postlingually deafened CI users to investigate the effect of multipulse train integration. 
One stimulation epoch consisted of varying numbers of pulses that were closely following one another so that they were perceived as a single sound.
This stimulation approach is different from standard eABR measurements as mostly single pulse trains are used.
It hence bridges the gap between standard eABR measurements to the more natural situation where the implanted electrodes receive amplitude modulated high frequency signals. 

### Can we infer the ideal stimulation range using eABR?

How strong the stimulation should be to percieve sound differs a lot from subject to subject. The adequate strength needs to be adjusted in a CI fitting process to avoid painful loudness or no perception at all when using the CI. 
The threshold level and the maximum comfortable level are commonly determined through psychophysics experiments that require feedback of the subjects. 
Feedback is not required in eABR measurements that can be used for diagnostic measures as one can infer the auditory nerve fiber activity in response to electrical stimulation.
This is done via ectrocencephalography (EEG) recordings with three electrodes as depicted in the figure.
These measurement can be done even with small infants unable to respond which is in fact the largest group of new implant receivers. 
Another aspect that was adressed in this study was therefore if eABR data can be used to infer the threshold to identify the ideal stimulation range even for subjects that cannot participate in psychophysics experiments. 

### How do neurotechnologies affect our society?

Working with CI users inspired my to pick up on this topic in her final essay of the MSNE course “Societal Impacts and Ethics” which addresses the relation between neuroengineering and society.  
In the case of CIs the societal aspect is particularily important as a ‘Deaf culture’ exists with own languages, traditions and values.
The development of the CI is often regarded as a threat to said culture and has led to a heated controversy, often referred to as the Cochlear Implant Debate which is useful to be aware of as a researcher in this field.

## Adaptation in Brains and Machines

![](/img/theses/steffen.png)

### Towards Robust Learning

Despite the successes of machine learning in recent years, deep neural networks fall short of the capabilities of biological brains when it comes to data efficiency and robustness to perturbations and changing environments.
In particular, biological brains are able to rapidly adapt to changing conditions and are robust across a large variety of perturbations to their input signals, such as background noise, occlusions in an image or color variations over the course of a day.

Consider changing lighting over the course of a day: Inferring that it is bright or dark in a room is an easier task than determining the content of the room.
However, after determining the lighting conditions, it is very easy to adapt parts of the perception process to account for them and improve on the actual recognition task.

This high level intuition of a source for robustness and adaptation in biological brains can then be translated into concrete experiments for artificial learning systems, which I investigated in my thesis.
To foster reproducible research for domain adaptation, all experiments are build on top of a modular and open source software library comprising popular existing domain adaptation approaches as baselines for the various experiments.

### One network, many conditions

An important sub-problem for the outlined adaptation scheme is the question of how the parameters of a single neural network can be quickly adapted to a range of conditions.
Two commonly applied approaches to this problem are to fine-tune either the full learning system, or the high-level parts of it, which either requires to adapt many parameters, or relies on the assumption that the previous high-level representation can easily be re-used even after the change.

A more sensible approach to account for both low level (brightness, local noise, etc.) and high level changes (rotations, scene composition, presence of background, etc.) is the adaptation of just a few parameters spread across the whole network.
Our empirical results demonstrate that this adaptation scheme is already quite powerful and often already sufficient to "solve" commonly studied adaptation problems in computer vision, as well as implementing adaptation to noise in a parameter-efficient way.
